# spa_react_app
Single Page Application with MERN

Configuration

In this project you will find two different configurations; client and server. We are going to explain step by step how you can set this project.

Fork the repo from this link and clone this project into your desired folder.

You need to install all the dependencies. As we are giving to you the server and the client, you need to configure both environments.

You should go to spa_react_app/server and install all the dependencies using npm. After this configuration you will need to start the server and populate the database.

cd spa_react_app/server

npm start

In the same way, and without closing server, you need to go to the repository root spa_react_app, where you can find the client, and proceed with the installation and configuration.

cd ..

npm

npm start

And that's all! You will have everything running so you can go ahead to http://localhost:3000 and proceed to test.
